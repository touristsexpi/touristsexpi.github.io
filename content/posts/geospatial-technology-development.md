Geospatial technologies are seen to be a driving force towards the revolutionization of agriculture, healthcare, revenue collection, urban planning, and disaster management sectors.
The increase of mobile technology such as 4G and 5G and the availability of inexpensive smartphone have allowed for participatory mapping exercises across the continent aiming and creating and data digitilization at a household scale. Various crowdsource mapping activities have been organized to support digitization of infrastructure and other social-economic data. Where the best part is all these datasets contain location information in it.

On the software side, the rise of open source software has allowed for a surge in adoption of geospatial tools and platforms that are cost-effective and community drive. Many institutions have started migrating to open source software such as QGIS, Geoserver instead of proprietary software which are expensive and unmaintainable in the long run.

Open source software can also be customized to accommodate specific requirements that are specific to certain communities or regions. This allows for language customizations for example supporting local languages and practices related to a specific region. These might include land management practices, urban planning.

A couple of government departments especially those that deal with spatial data and startups have recognized the benefits of open source geospatial solutions.
A number of organizations and projects have successfully implemented their projects solely using open source geospatial solutions. An example of this is Ramani Huria project that amongst its achievements managed to digitally map the whole of Dar es Salaam region using open source geospatial solutions.

Open-source geospatial tools can be easily integrated into a plethora of other open source tools such as the infamous RDBMS PostgreSQL database and Python scripting language. This integration enables for the development of complex solutions that include permanent data storage and complex thematic web applications.

Last but not least, the development of geospatial technology has provide an excellent platform for educational institutions and training programs. Several universities through different programs and projects have established boot camps and mapping marathons that aim at equipping students with valuable skills. The outputs of these initiative have massively added benefits to the local communities and the government in Tanzania. As our country continues to embrace open source geospatial solutions, it is poised to unlock new opportunities and address pressing challenges.
